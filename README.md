# smartmeter-p1-v1
Readout of a Flemish smartmeter via the P1 port ad publish it to MQTT.
The readut uses the DSMR v5 protocol.

Software

The software is intended to run on an ESP8266 device.
This version is made with the Arduino IDE.

Harware

I made a motherboard containing a Wemos D1 mini R2 and the hardware to connect tot the P1 port of the energy-meter. Later I swapped the mini R2 with a mini Pro, because the poor WiFi signal at my meter. So both can be used.

Both software and hardware are running fine at my home. Using any of this is at your own risk.
