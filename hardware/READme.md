The board is setup to be it's own housing.

The first prototype, so the board was not cleaned after soldering.

The device in action on the meter.
There is a lid, but the hole for the LED is not aligned. 
Also I didn't mount the switch because I didn't have a suitable type.
That switch is there to reset the device to "factory seetings".
